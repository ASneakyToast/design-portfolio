I am currently in the middle of working with the marketing and communications team for California College of the Arts on reviewing and restructuring their admissions content on <a href="https://cca.edu" target="_blank">CCA.edu</a>. After adressing stakeholders, internal research, and google analytics, we plan on taking action through content rewording, creating new page templates and components, along with incorporating the design team with graphic space.
