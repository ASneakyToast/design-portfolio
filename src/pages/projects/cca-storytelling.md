Storytelling is an ever-present part of CCA's Marketing & Communication strategy. Using vev.design, a no-code webpage builder, I created responsive and dynamic articles for the CCA Newsroom.
Below are the articles I created throughout my time as the part-time visual designer. 

#### Pre-College
A story-focused marketing piece for the pre-college program. Students were given dispoable cameras during their stay.

#### Blind-throwing competition
The ceramics department hosts an annual blind-throwing competition. For the first time this event was hosted on the San Francisco campus, so a story was made to highlight the community.

#### Back-to-school spirit
A community focused story about the start of the semester events.

#### Creative Citizenship
An informational story about an internal organization that promotes activism within the academic arts.
