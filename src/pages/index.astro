			<h1>üë±‚Äçü§ùü§ñ Hello, BattleBots!</h1>
			<p>
        I quickly put together this site to showcase some of my UX Design work, because I've been doing design for the same company the last few years I haven't needed to have a portfolio until now! Below are a few projects I have worked on within the past couple years.
      </p>

			<ul class="projects">
				<li>
          <p><b><a href="/projects/cca-admissions">CCA Admissions Content</a></b>, <i>in-progress</i></p>
          <p>My soon-to-be full-time job as California College of the Arts's UX Designer. I am currently over-seeing the restructuring and enhancement of the admissions content on CCA.edu.</p>
        </li>
				<li>
          <p><b><a href="/projects/cca-storytelling">CCA Storytelling</a></b>, <i>2022</i></p>
          <p>During my time as a visual designer I used a no-code page builder to creat dynamic story-based web-experiences for CCA's newsroom.</p>
        </li>
				<li>
          <p><b><a href="/projects/onequicktrick">Artist Website for Joseph Blake</a></b>, <i>2022</i></p>
          <p>Joseph Blake is an up-and-coming bay area artist, and a close friend, who needed an artist portfolio site for residencies and galleries he was applying to.</p>
        </li>
				<li>
          <p><b><a href="/projects/knowledge-base">Knowledge Base for CCA's internal Portal</a></b>, <i>2020-2021</i></p>
          <p>The Knowledge Base is an internal set of self-help resources for CCA students/staff/faculty and is intended to be a unified replacement to google docs.</p>
        </li>
				<li>
          <p><b><a href="/projects/web-team-workflow">Design workflow for CCA's web-team</a></b>, <i>2019-2021</i></p>
          <p>Over the years working with CCA's internal web-team I formalized a design workflow for handoff with the developers that they still currently use.</p>
        </li>
			</ul>

        If there's any projects you'd like to learn more about just let me know and I can include more detail and we can have a further conversation about it!
